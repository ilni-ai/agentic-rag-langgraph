## Page 1: Account and Billing Inquiries

### Q1: How can I view and pay my bill?

A: The easiest way to manage your bill is through the **MyRogers** account:

* Online: Sign in to your MyRogers account on the website. You can view your current bill, past bills (up to 18 months), make a one-time payment, or set up Automatic Payments.
* MyRogers App: Open the app and sign in. You can quickly view your balance, due date, and make payments.

Other Payment Methods: You can also pay through online banking (add Rogers as a payee using your 12-digit account number), by phone, or by mail.

### Q2: Why is my first bill higher than expected?

A: Your first bill often includes one-time and partial charges that cover different periods:

* One-time Service Setup Fee (SSF): A one-time fee, typically $80.00 plus taxes, is applied for new activations or hardware upgrades.
* Partial Month Charges: You are billed for the service from the date of activation up to your regular billing cycle date.
* Advance Charges: You are also billed for the next full month of service in advance.

Action: Review the detailed breakdown on your first bill in MyRogers under "Current Charges."

### Q3: What should I do if I have a charge on my bill I don't understand?

A:

1. Check the Details: Sign in to MyRogers (or MyRogers (Shaw) if applicable) and view the detailed PDF of your bill. Charges are usually listed clearly under "Current Charges." Look for things like:
    * Data Add-Ons or Overage Fees (if you exceeded your plan's limit).
    * Long-Distance Charges or Roam Like Home fees from travel.
    * Equipment Rental/Financing fees.
2. Contact Support: If the charge still seems incorrect, you can:
    * Use the Chat feature in the MyRogers app or online.
    * Call Customer Service to initiate a bill dispute.

### Q4: How do I update my payment information or set up/cancel automatic payments?

A: This is best done as a self-serve transaction in your online account:

1. Sign in to MyRogers.
2. Go to the Billing & Payment section.
3. Look for Payment Method or Set up Automatic Payments to update your credit card or bank account details.

Note: If you remove automatic payments, you may lose any associated discounts (e.g., a typical $10/month discount).

### Q5: I am moving. How do I transfer my services to a new address?

A: You should notify Rogers as soon as possible, ideally 30 days before your move date, to ensure a smooth transition:

1. Contact Rogers: Call the dedicated Moving Team or use the self-serve options on the website/app for moving home services (Internet, TV, Home Phone).
2. Confirm Services: Rogers will confirm service availability at your new address and schedule a technician appointment if necessary for installation.
3. Return Equipment: If your new address uses different technology or services, you may need to return your existing equipment. Rogers will provide instructions and shipping labels.

### Q6: I have no service (no dial tone, no internet, no TV). What is the first step?

A: Your first step should be to check for local outages:

1. Check the Network Status: Visit the Rogers Network and Outage Hub online or use the MyRogers app to see if there are any reported service issues or outages in your specific area.
2. Restart Your Equipment: For Internet, TV, or Home Phone issues, try a power cycle:
    * Unplug the power cord from the modem, TV box, or phone terminal.
    * Wait about 60 seconds.
    * Plug the power cord back in. Wait 5-10 minutes for the equipment to fully restart and connect to the network.
3. Still No Service: If the network status is clear and a restart didn't help, contact Technical Support via the MyRogers app chat (available 24/7) or by phone.

### Q7: My Wi-Fi signal is weak or slow. How can I improve my internet performance?

A: A weak Wi-Fi signal is often due to the home environment, not the internet line itself. Try the following:

* Router Placement: Ensure your modem/router is placed in a central, open location, off the floor, away from concrete walls, metal objects, and large appliances (microwaves, cordless phones).
* Interference: Check for other electronics that might interfere with your signal (especially devices using 2.4 GHz frequency).
* Restart Regularly: Power-cycle your modem/router once a month to clear its memory and refresh the connection.
* Use the App: Use the Ignite WiFi Hub app (for Rogers Ignite customers) to run diagnostics, test speeds, and optimize your network.
* Consider a Mesh Network: If you have a large home, consider adding Rogers Wi-Fi Pods or a mesh network to extend coverage.

### Q8: How do I troubleshoot issues with my TV service (e.g., freezing, missing channels)?

A:

1. Restart Your TV Box: Unplug the power cord from your Ignite TV box, wait 60 seconds, and plug it back in.
2. Check Connections: Ensure all cables (coaxial, HDMI) are securely connected to the TV box and the wall outlet.
3. Refresh Your Channel Listings: This can often be done through the MyRogers app or website.
4. Still Having Issues: If the problem persists, contact Technical Support.

### Q9: How can I change my TV package or add/remove channels (Flex Channels)?

A: Most changes to your TV package or channels can be managed easily online:

1. Sign in to MyRogers.
2. Navigate to the My Services section and select your TV service.
3. Follow the prompts to modify your package or exchange your Flex Channels (this is usually a self-serve-only transaction).

Note: Making changes to your package may affect your overall monthly price and promotional discounts.

### Q11: How do I activate a new phone or SIM card?

A:

* New Device/SIM with New Line: The device or SIM card usually comes with activation instructions. You can often activate it online through a dedicated activation page on the Rogers website.
* eSIM: You can request to switch your physical SIM card to an eSIM directly through the MyRogers app or website's self-serve options.
* Transferring a Number (Port-in): If you are keeping a number from another provider, Rogers will manage the transfer process. Do NOT cancel your old service yourself; Rogers will initiate the cancellation upon successful transfer.

### Q12: I am travelling. How does 'Roam Like Home' work?

A:

* Automatic Enrollment: Most Rogers customers are automatically enrolled in Roam Like Home.
* How it Works: For a flat daily fee (which varies by zone), you can use the talk, text, and data included in your monthly plan while traveling in eligible destinations.
* Billing: The daily fee is only charged on the days you actively use your device (make a call, send a text, or use data) in the eligible zone. It is capped monthly.
* Before You Go: Always check the current daily fee and eligible countries on the Rogers website before your trip.

### Q13: What should I do if my phone is lost or stolen?

A: Act immediately to prevent unauthorized charges:

1. Report it: Sign in to the MyRogers app or call Rogers Customer Service immediately to report the device as lost or stolen.
2. Suspend Service: Rogers will suspend your line to prevent unauthorized usage.
3. Device Protection: If you have Device Protection, you can file a claim to get a replacement device (subject to deductible and claim limits).
4. Security Measures: Use your phone's built-in features (e.g., Find My iPhone, Google Find My Device) to try and locate or remotely wipe the device.

### Q14: How does the Device Financing (and Save & Return program) work?

A:

* Device Financing: The cost of your device is split into monthly payments over a 24-month term and added to your bill. Once the term ends, the device is paid off, and the monthly financing charge stops.
* Save & Return: This option lowers your upfront monthly device payment in exchange for a Save & Return Credit.
    * At the end of your 24-month term, you have two options:
        1. Return the device (in good working condition) to settle the outstanding Save & Return Credit.
        2. Keep the device and pay the Save & Return Credit amount (either in full or in installments).

### Q15: My phone is having technical issues (calls dropping, no data). What should I try?

A:

1. Restart Your Phone: The simplest fix for most mobile issues.
2. Check for Outages: Use the Rogers Network and Outage Hub to rule out local service issues.
3. Check Data/Call Settings: Ensure your mobile data is on and that you don't have features like Airplane Mode or Do Not Disturb accidentally enabled.
4. SIM Card: If you are seeing a "No SIM" or "SIM Error" message, try gently removing and re-inserting your SIM card.
5. Online Troubleshooting: Rogers has extensive interactive device guides on their support website that walk you through step-by-step troubleshooting for almost any phone model and issue.
